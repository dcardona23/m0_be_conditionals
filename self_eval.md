# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
Conditionals are useful to generate different results depending on the input that is received. For example, conditionals can be used to direct a user to the correct result or ensure that a user has the right credentials to get where they are trying to go. Conditionals allow the computer to provide different output depending on the input that it receives. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
If I could do this assignment over, I would spend less time spinning my wheels and ask for help. For example, when working on the password section of the assignment, I kept generating the wrong output despite repeatedly modifying the code. I finally figured out that I needed to use `==` instead of `=`, but it took a long time to get there.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I was really excited when I was able to solve the third code challenge because it required independent research and a lot of trial and error. I was also able to use everything that I learned and really see how it could be used to obtain more complex results.
